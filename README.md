# Symfony Micro Template

This Symfony project template is designed for quickly starting small projects with HTTP API functionality.
It automatically discovers controllers in the `src/Controllers` directory (controllers must be annotated with the `Symfony\Component\Routing\Attribute\Route` attribute).

Perfect for developers looking to jumpstart lightweight Symfony-based API applications with minimal setup. 

Note: This template is not intended for use in production environments.

## Installation

composer create-project yevgen-grytsay/symfony-micro-template my-project -s dev
